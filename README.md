In this project I will be creating a simple recipe website using HTML and the terminal exclusively.
Skills I will be utilizing:
-Creating HTML files for the different web pages
-Practicing the HTML boiler plate template
-Working with text (paragraphs, strong, emphasis, and comments)
-Creating unordered and ordered lists, practicing nesting them within each other
-Creating links and adding images properly
-Using necessary attributes of elements and getting creative with some I've learned
