        <h2>What is Shakshuka?</h2>
        <p>
            Shakshuka (or shakshouka) is a traditional Tunisian dish featuring 
            poached eggs in a spicy tomato sauce with onions, bell pepper, and 
            garlic. It's usually eaten for breakfast, but I think it makes a 
            tasty lunch or dinner, served with lots of bread to mop up the sauce.
